        <!-- <p>I’m particularly interested in art. I took acting classes that were supposed to prepare me directly to acting college, I really enjoy musicals and theatre plays. I practice guitar, piano and singing on my own. I'm also very active, I played baseball in a team and we managed to win polish championship twice in a row; I played volleyball for 10 years as a kid and I'm running just to train my stamina for long distances. I’m also into cosplay and modelling. I’m tech-savvy, interested in IT since childhood. I like gaming, usually stream on twitch variety of games as well as speedrunning some of them. I’m also fan of retro consoles. I'm an IT technican, always trying to learn something new and explore secrets of IT. I've just finished a Frontend development course with PurpleBeard. I've also took part in few GameJams to further improve my experience and learn some new usefull skills!</p> -->
